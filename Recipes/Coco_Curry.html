    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Ever wanted to eat some of that hot steaming curry you see in all of your favorite anime?
        Well I have no clue if this is going to be that or not. You see, the image above is one that I found online that
        simply looks cute.
        The recipe that follows relates to a completely unrelated coconut curry recipe I stumbled upon by chance.
        However, if you're even reading this you're probably either (A) a coder or (B) someone cool I sent
        this to review my work. In both cases im sure you're just glad to eat something other than pizza or cheetos and
        gatorade.

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps (How tf you make this)</h2>
    <p1>(While I realise it is somewhat redundant to have step 1 followed by the number 1 in front of the step itself I
        did it anyways. Oh whats that you want to know why? Its because I CODED THIS. I also just wanted to use the
        Ordered list element because i'm chill like that)</p1>
    <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Bring the water and rice to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 45 minutes.</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and garlic, and cook 1 minute. Mix in
            cod, and season with curry powder, chili powder, turmeric, cumin, salt, and pepper. Pour in the coconut
            milk, and mix in frozen vegetables. Cover, and cook 10 minutes, or until vegetables are tender and cod is
            easily flaked with a fork.</li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>Drain 1/2 cup liquid from the skillet into a bowl, and mix with cornstarch. Stir back into skillet to
            thicken sauce. Serve over the cooked rice.</li>
    </ol>
